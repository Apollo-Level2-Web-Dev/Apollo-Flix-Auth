# **Bonus: Calculate and Show Average Rating Using Mongoose Virtuals**

To display the average rating for each movie using Mongoose virtuals, follow these steps:

1. **Define the Mongoose Schema with Virtuals**:
2. **Modify the Response to Include the Virtual `avgRating`**:

Ensure that when you send a movie or list of movies as a response, the virtual field **`avgRating`** is included

**Test the Virtual Field**:

Verify that the **`avgRating`** field is correctly calculated and included in the responses by making requests to your API endpoints.

By using Mongoose virtuals, you can dynamically compute and include the average rating for each movie in your responses without storing the computed value in the database. This approach keeps your database schema clean and your calculations up-to-date.
